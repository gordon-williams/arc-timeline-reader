She said this was the biggest surprise of her whole life!\n\nWe had a special closed-off and air-conditioned area on the verandah for the party. It was a very hot and humid day so it was good to be in there. The children's play room was really hot even with the windows and door open - probably because of all the video games in the small room.",
