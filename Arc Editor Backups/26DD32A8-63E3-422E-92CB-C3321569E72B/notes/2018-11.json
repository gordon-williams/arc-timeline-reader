    "body" : "First we had dinner at Grill’d. I had the plain burger without mayo. All their burgers have mayo and tomato relish. I think they have a lot of garlic in the beef patty, so the meal sat heavy in my stomach the rest of the evening (still suffering the next morning)\n\nThen while Anita and Katherine went clothes shopping I spent some time at the Apple Store testing the new Apple Pencil and iPad Pro.\n\nThen I went to JB HiFi and bought the 2TB WiFi hard drive with a built-in SD card reader for $299.\n\nCaught up with the others in the Myers store and we had coffee at the Shingle Inn before going home.",
